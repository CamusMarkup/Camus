force break: br|br||eak.
or directly: br<br />eak.

<pre>
pre still functions as usual.
but even in pre tag lines are affected by camus.
e\.g\. |b|this| is still bold.
</pre>

the problem of printing &lt; and &gt;:<br />
you just write them as usual.

hr:  
include test.

there are 2 kind of INCLUDE:
ul.
li: INCLUDE[X], where X will be processed by camus.
li: INCLUDE-RAW[X], where X will not be processed.

end[ul].

example\:

INCLUDE[test2.cm]: This is test2.cm.
INCLUDE-RAW[test2.cm]: This is test2.cm.

hr.
link test.

there are 2 kinds of LINK:

ul.
li: LINK[X], where X will be processed.
li: LINK-RAW[X], which works as a simple &lt;a&gt; tag.
end[ul].


LINK[test2.cm]: This is a link to the file generated from test2.cm.

|LINK[test2.cm]. this| is also a link to the file generated from test2.cm.

LINK-RAW[test2.cm]: This is a link to test2.cm.

h3: v0.1 beta 20171030: REFER and LABEL
you might not notice them. click |REFER[top]. here|. <br />
|LABEL[a_label]. now you're back here again.|

you can also use them like:
LABEL[chapter_1]: Chapter 1: Basic Input/Output Functions

and then:
REFER[chapter_1]: Go to the beginning of chapter 1.

btw you can use tags like this now:

h3: this word is bold (normally), but this |i|word| is italic.

hr.
h3: v20180710: INCLUDE-RAW and LINK-RAW

The looping reference bug is also fixed. check out loopref-test.cm.
