<pre>
pre still functions as usual.
but even in pre tag lines are affected by camus.
e\.g\. |b|this| is still bold.
</pre>
the problem of printing &lt; and &gt;:<br />
you just write them as usual.


hr:  
include test.

there are 2 kind of INCLUDE:
ul.
li: INCLUDE[X], where X will be processed by camus.
li: INCLUDE-RAW[X], where X will not be processed.
END[ul].
example\:

INCLUDE[test2.cm]: This is test2.cm.
INCLUDE-RAW[test2.cm]: This is test2.cm.

hr.
link test.

there are 2 kinds of LINK:

ul.
li: LINK[X], where X will be processed.
li: LINK-RAW[X], which works as a simple &lt;a&gt; tag.
END[ul].
LINK[test2.cm]: This is a link to the file generated from test2.cm.

|LINK[test2.cm]. this| is also a link to the file generated from test2.cm.

LINK-RAW[test2.cm]: This is a link to test2.cm.


hr.
h3: v0.1 beta 20171030: REFER and LABEL
you might not notice them. click |REFER[top]. here|. <br />
|LABEL[a_label]. now you're back here again.|

you can also use them like:
LABEL[chapter_1]: Chapter 1: Basic Input/Output Functions

and then:
REFER[chapter_1]: Go to the beginning of chapter 1.

btw you can use tags like this now:

h3: this word is bold (normally), but this |i|word| is italic.

hr.
h3: v20180710: INCLUDE-RAW and LINK-RAW
ul.
li: The looping reference bug is also fixed. check out loopref-test.cm.
li.
The rules for empty lines has also changed: there will be no implicit &lt;p&gt; tags,
one empty line is converted to one &lt;br /&gt;, and 2 or more than 2 empty lines are converted to two br tags.
END[li].
li: block-level attributes are now supported.
END[ul].
block-level tag attributes.
div[style="font-size:80%",id="test"].

hr.
h3: v20180712: HEADER, END, IMG
ul.
li: now block-level body tag is no longer required; camus will generate <body> automatically.
li: the bug where \|br\|\| generates &lt;br&gt; &lt;/br&gt; (which will be the same as two &lt;br/&gt;s) is fixed. from now on level-1 in-line tags with no content will be converted into something like &lt;TAG /&gt;.
li: block-level end tag is replaced with END for the sake of consistency.
li: IMG[X] is introduced as a shorthand of img[src="X"].
